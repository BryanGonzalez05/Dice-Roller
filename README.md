# Dice Roller 

This is a project I made to further learning and practice my html, css, and javascript skills.
I wanted to create a website that allowed users to roll a dice. I also wanted to know how I could
use the Math.random in a projects and this gave me the idea.

To use it you first need to add a number of dice you wish to roll.

Once you select the number of dice you wish to roll it will output the number and the image of the dice.
